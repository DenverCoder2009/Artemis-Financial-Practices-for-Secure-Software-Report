# Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report


The client Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that developes individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrions. Artemis Financial needed to modernize and get the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial needs to add file verification to the web application, and they will need a checksum as well. Adding secure communication mechanisms is the requirements for this project. Understanding that Artemis Financial deals with very sensetive information allowed me to identify the correct algorithm cyphers for the job. It is important to code securely because it typically costs more down to road to pay fines and then impliment the correct security anyway. The aspect of working through the vulnerability assessment that I found challenging was the amount of information that I had to sift through in order to determine what was a valid vulnerability. Increasing the layers of security lead to encrypting the data with SHA256 bit encryption. I ensured the sofware was secure by analyzing the code both manually and with maven. Resources that were very helpful were sites like the NVD or redhat.
